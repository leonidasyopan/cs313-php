				<h2>Professional Profile</h2>
				<p>I developed my first websites when I was only 16 years old using plain HTML. I achieved this by opening the websiteâ€™s source code and testing the code through trial and error. This was an amazing experience to start learning.</p>
				<p>I am 34 years old now, and my skills as a web developer, combined with my capacity for collaborating with other professionals, allows me to be a strong front-end developer.</p>
				<p>Most of my professional life I have owned my own business. I started the first one when I was only 23 years old. It was an English School. Nowadays, besides the English School - I stil own one - I also have a small Video Production company.</p>
				<p>This experience, of owning my own business has allowed me a very indept experience on how to deal with people. From dealing, serving and attending clients to managing and leading our staff. I believe I am a great team worker.</p>
